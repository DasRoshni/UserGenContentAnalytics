       "['Entry level performance luxury sedans are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike.  These sedans show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well.  They show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans. The selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied.The benchmarks which define this are the BMW 330 and the Audi A4 3.0.  But there are many contenders, such as Acura TL-S, Chrysler 300M, Jaguar X-type, Infiniti I35, Mercedes C-Class, Volvo S60 T5.  Some companies have contenders that emphasize performance Lexus IS300 or luxury Lexus ES300.  And the field is continously growing, with the recent additions being the Cadillac CTS and Infiniti G35.The common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k (US dollars) and 0-60 times between six and eight seconds.With this wide variety of cars targeted at a similar market segment, the choices for our own personal car are great.  But with all these choices, it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options.  So this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the cars available in this entry level performance luxury field.',\n",
       " 'I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group.  It\\'s still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe.   The C320 \"Sport\" needs to have it\\'s suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride.  MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package.  The C240\\'s 6-speed wouldn\\'t hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be \"fixed\" first. That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0.   The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite.   The single thing I don\\'t like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car.  This trim doesn\\'t match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway.   This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K.  The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners. The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I\\'m (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants.   I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling.  I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class.  Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver.  Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular.  This car\\'s main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc.  Otherwise a standout. Lexus ES300.  Nice, but not my type of car at all.  This is one for the Buick set.  The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis.  Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn\\'t look like a 35K car (grown).  The interior is gawd-awful.  Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start.  In their defense Toyota didn\\'t initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job. The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here.  I\\'ve seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better.  Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues.  The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid.  If you\\'re going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother?  Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car???  The seats are very good though, as is the handling.  A work in progress. The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces.  Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.Don\\'t really care much for the X-Type.  If I were a Jaguar man I\\'d be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one.  They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I\\'ve read where they\\'re thinking about selling it here!  Hell no.  The car should have been rwd not awd.  Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi.  Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd.  It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar \"leaper\" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come.  This new 300M \"Special\" is truly a good looking car inside and out.  One problem: Where is the performance????  A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable.  Something is not right here.  Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car.  The heavier E320 with less power is faster.   I still like this car, but it\\'s no lust object once you get past the great styling.  M',\n",
       " \"I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.\",\n",
       " 'Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around.  Easy winner.',\n",
       " \"And no manual tranny.  That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.So IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'.\",\n",
       " \"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from.  Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan.  Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!hungrywhale...  I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!\",\n",
       " \"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual.  Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto.  That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car.  Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider.\",\n",
       " \"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto.  I don't care how fast it is.  It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car.\",\n",
       " \"I understand it's not about the speed.  I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark.  What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it.  Will I buy an auto-equipped G?  In all likelihood, no.  I desperately want to drive the 6 speed.\",\n",
       " \"It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.\",\n",
       " 'Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan?  Not in my book.  Certainly not in Europe or Asia.  Only in America is such an oxymoron possible.  Sad.If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment.',\n",
       " 'If I had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what I would choose:Audi A4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)Cadillac CTS( Decent BTFB, good handling, non-lemming style)Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)SAAB Viggen(almost zero BFTB, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world). Everything else is not worth my time',\n",
       " 'Hey my friend, dig this, in Australia, the ONLY 5-Series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the M5!  Yeah, right, not the 525i, 530i, 535i or the 540i, they are all automatic only.  :-(Best Regards,Shipo',\n",
       " '>\"Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan? Not in my book. Certainly not in Europe or Asia. Only in America is such an oxymoron possible. Sad. If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment.\"Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan.  From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife\\'s) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That\\'s belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW\\'s etc. with automatics. When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I\\'m leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there. I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many \"experts\" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven\\'t even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW \"supportors\" don\\'t even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make \"unsupported\" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund\\'s BMW 3-series discussion).  I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn\\'t classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.Again, I\\'m not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I\\'m interested in and make my choice from there. I\\'m also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I\\'m shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.Cheers!',\n",
       " \"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny.  Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one.\",\n",
       " 'amen',\n",
       " \"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling. I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class.\",\n",
       " \"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it.  Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one.  They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti.\",\n",
       " \"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though. Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies.\",\n",
       " '\"I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus\"How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then? Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so.',\n",

Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans.  But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans.  (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic.  If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)\",\n",
       " \"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do.  I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.It does make a difference being married. (LOL!  see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board).  First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic.  But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy.\",\n",

The C240\\'s 6-speed wouldn\\'t hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be \"fixed\" first. That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0.   The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite.   The single thing I don\\'t like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car.  This trim doesn\\'t match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway.   This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K.  The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners. The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I\\'m (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants.   I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling.  I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class.  Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver.  Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular.  This car\\'s main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc.  Otherwise a standout. Lexus ES300.  Nice, but not my type of car at all.  This is one for the Buick set.  The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis.  Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn\\'t look like a 35K car (grown).  The interior is gawd-awful.  Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start.  In their defense Toyota didn\\'t initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job. The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here.  I\\'ve seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better.  Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues.  The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid.  If you\\'re going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother?  Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car???  The seats are very good though, as is the handling.  A work in progress. The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces.  Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.Don\\'t really care much for the X-Type.  If I were a Jaguar man I\\'d be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one.  They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I\\'ve read where they\\'re thinking about selling it here!  Hell no.  The car should have been rwd not awd.  Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi.  Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd.  It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar \"leaper\" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come.  This new 300M \"Special\" is truly a good looking car inside and out.  One problem: Where is the performance????  A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable.  Something is not right here.  Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car.  The heavier E320 with less power is faster.   I still like this car, but it\\'s no lust object once you get past the great styling.  M',\n",

From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife\\'s) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either.

I\\'m leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there. I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans.

Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds.  Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says:  \"Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion\".  This is off the tech specs on page 30.  I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure.

From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs.  Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting.  And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system.  It is due to other factors.  Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers.  Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts.  Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.From standing start, floor your car.  See if the wheel pulls in one direction.  You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.

I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren\\'t we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life.  As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily.  Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough.  Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else.  The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades.  As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV\\'s, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old.  They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo.  We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II.  I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me.  What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect.  There is very little innovation or risk taking.  That is why the cars are so bland.  When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan?  VCR\\'s, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese.  The same goes for cars.  Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they\\'re going to get!).Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break.  Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances.  And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.I\\'ll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing.',\n",

I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice.  I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways.  For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)Take straight line acceleration, for instance.  VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec.  To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan.  My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is:  0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims.  And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95.  I base this on a number of things.  For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic.  The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258.  And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94.  Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better.  We&#146;ll see. . .  (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90.  This was my previous car.  So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package.

Great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. With leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don\\'t.330i - same as above but better power, although I find the power to be linear. You can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. I like that sunroof and leather are std. Better value overall than 325i plus std. 17\" wheels (although with all-seasons).  Pricy.IS300- Nice manual tranny and smooth motor. That\\'s about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy. X-Type - I liked the 3.0L Sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. Didn\\'t look like a jag. Very nearly purchased a 3.0L British Racing Green with Ivory Leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the BMW look like a bargain hunter.  Too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. Brakes were strong.  One thing about the motor was it just didn\\'t feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised.  Nicest interior overall.A4 3.0 - Porky, ponderous even with sport package. Did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. Nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. By the way, the leather in the BMW was much better.S4 (2001)- Nice but not as fast as I thought it would be (I did drive a 99 Mustang GT). It rockets off the line but it isn\\'t that impressive afterwards.  Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4. I think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note. An exhaust would be perfect here.  They were giving them away (9000$ off MSRP - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.G35 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, I wasn\\'t interested one bit. I still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the S4). Nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers. I really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. The fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the A4 3.0 and BMW 330i was close.Lincoln LS V6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. Engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move.  Torque is lacking here.  But I liked the car overall, especially with the Sport susp.Acura TL-S, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite V6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. Interior average and handling so-so.  Excellent price.Volvo S60 T5 - I chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the S4 is quite close to the S4, and it is lighter) FWD torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no question  about it. Best seats, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the Jaguar and BMW.  Brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to. Amazing power and style. Seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest.  Price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than BMW, Audi, Jaguar.

The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal.  The car\\'s a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing.

I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.ACCELERATION:In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi.  Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, \"Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn\\'t feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i.  But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW.  We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE\\'s V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.\"Road&Track says of the X-TYPE\\'s performance, \"In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest.  Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300\\'s and Audi A4\\'s 7.1, the Mercedes C320\\'s 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i\\'s time.\"-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.* = manual transmission.HANDLING:Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, \"Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn\\'t work.  It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners.  Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, \\'This thing is really good in the curves!\\'  It\\'s a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in.  The engine is not bad either.  Our test car\\'s optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there\\'s a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.\"  They also say of its suspension, \"Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be \\'connected but relaxed,\\'and that seems to wrap it up nicely.  The ride is about as smooth as you\\'ll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension.  Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.\"Of the Audi\\'s handling, they say, \"Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks.  It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive.  It\\'s a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn\\'t feel very sporty doing it, despite our car\\'s having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced \\'considerable excitement,\\' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others.  And again, \\'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,\\' one driver noted.  The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.\"STEERING:Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE\\'s ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, \"The car\\'s best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering.  In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series.  Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel.  With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track.  The only all-wheel-drive car we\\'ve ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.\"The Audi\\'s steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, \"rubbery\" in feeling, and C&D said that the \"steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.\"Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE \"is nothing short of terrific.\"  They call it \"enthusiast goods\".Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, \"Jaguar engineers boast it\\'s the best steering system they\\'ve ever had on any model.  We agree.\"ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now.  Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4.  It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available.  Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6.  Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected.  This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car.  Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.Forbes stated of the X-TYPE\\'s AWD, \"The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi\\'s vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.\"Road&Track said that, \"...The Jag is better balanced.  It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through.  It\\'s a safe and secure feeling that signals what\\'s about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust\"BRAKING:The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.Road & Track said, \"In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)\"  In another one of their articles, they say, \"The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.\"Car & Driver also said, \"A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE\\'s handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive.  Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle.  The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.\"By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag.  The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet.  An SLK32 AMG does',\n",

The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details.  I really like the interiors of both cars.  The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi\\'s air vents seems more resilient, etc.Road&Track said that, \"Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there\\'s birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag\\'s interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges.\"  They say it \"may be an \\'entry level\\' model, but you wouldn\\'t know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.\"Motor Trend says the X-TYPE \"has great styling inside and out\", and says specifically that the interior is \"soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint.  The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel.  HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It\\'s pure Jag inside and out.\"Car&Driver says \"As you\\'d expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird\\'s-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors.  Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.\"_____________________________eaweg-My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more.  It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason.  It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader.  AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood.

While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they\\'re ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists. Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth. Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems. While he says he loves his X-Type, Miller is frustrated by his dealer\\'s inability to repair the problems, despite three visits to the service bay. \"I made a tape recording of the noise,\" Miller said. \"The attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the all-wheel-drive system. This quieted the noise for several days, then it came back.\" ...This is what turned me away...before this article came out I had heard about this...I hope it doesn\\'t happen to you guys!

I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn\\'t \\'feel\\' right with the x-type.  The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision.  I have to be honest and say that it was the \\'Quattro\\' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal.  My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.  I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a \\'perfect car\\' off the lot (even though we all should).  Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems.  Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none.  What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...\"Quality problems bedevil Jaguar\\'s X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited\"...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they\\'re ready to bolt the franchise......There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers. The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket. But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time. This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists. Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth. Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems. While he says he loves his X-Type, Miller is frustrated by his dealer\\'s inability to repair the problems, despite three visits to the service bay. \"I made a tape recording of the noise,\" Miller said. \"The attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the all-wheel-drive system. This quieted the noise for several days, then it came back.\" ...This is what turned me away...before this article came out I had heard about this...I hope it doesn\\'t happen to you guys!  Thanks for the friendly chat!',\n",
       " 'Congrats on your A4! Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn\\'t come to grips with it.I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller.  i think it is unfair and untrue to say the \"Ford\" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not.  The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).  the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch.  the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn\\'t justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is  safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!',\n",
       " 'I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best.  I don\\'t think there is \"a best\" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences.  They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.On the X-TYPE article:I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end.  Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don\\'t have any of those problems.  I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems.  The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars.  They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one.  Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability.  Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all.  It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I\\'ve had it.  I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.Again, it is all personal preference.  When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right.  I hadn\\'t even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect.  Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect.  The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.And if anyone is paying off the media it\\'s BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most.  I don\\'t think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they\\'ve had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board.  Take care of your car!____________________________Blueguydotcom-I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it.  The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!).  It\\'s also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher.  I\\'d like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year.  Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own.  Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier.',\n",

       " \"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April.  In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE.  X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S.  Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May.  Jaguar is very happy with its sales.  Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar.  Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year.  The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well.\",\n",

Yes I was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you I think my personality fits my choice.  You are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment.  For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn\\'t see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life.  For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can\\'t pinpoint it thought.  The \\'02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty \"odd\" the first couple of months.  I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it.  To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May.  Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327).',\n",

To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.By your thinking: \"You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts\", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300\\'s sales volume since they share those same parts too.
